    <h4>Fun Facts About Our Team</h4>
    <p> Our team used a driving base with many attachments as our competition robot. 

        Our team ate pizza at all our out-of-school meetings and on competition day. 
        
        Our team made two trifolds: One to explain our robot and one for our Innovation Project. 
        
        Our team has many artists on it, which inspired our Innovation Projectâ€™s topic. 
        
        Our team was in connection with mentors from FTC and other FLL teams, allowing us to get advice from more advanced FIRST members. </p>
