                    Our club relies primarily on donations from generous individuals to sustain its operations. We
                    organize outreach events to collect funds for purchasing parts and covering other expenses.
                    Additionally, we host a significant fundraiser that serves as our primary source of income, ensuring
                    the continuous functioning of the club.
