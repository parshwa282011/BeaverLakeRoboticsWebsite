                        Our club consists of three FLL teams and two FTC teams. The FLL teams are designated for 6th and
                        7th graders, while the FTC teams are tailored for 7th and 8th graders.

                    This year both teams participated Spencer League Meets and Tesla Interleague Tournament
                    where both teams were selected for playoffs. In WTI both teams were picked to do playoffs and
                    Alpha Intelligence won.

                        This year, Alpha Intelligence and Beta Bionix collaborated extensively on outreach initiatives.
                        We mentored three school FLL teams, showcased our robot to kids during Salmon Days, and
                        conducted a Girl Scout presentation to teach them about FIRST.

                    This year, all the teams competed in a tournament aiming to progress to the next level of
                    competition. Only one team, Robotic Dogs, managed to advance. This marked the first time an FLL team
                    from our club advanced to the state level. At the state competition, Robotic Dogs secured the 11th
                    position.
