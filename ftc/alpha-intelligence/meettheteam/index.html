                        Our club relies primarily on donations from generous individuals to sustain 
                        its operations. We organize outreach events to collect funds for purchasing parts 
                        and covering other expenses. Additionally, we host a significant fundraiser that 
                        serves as our primary source of income, ensuring the continuous functioning of the club.
