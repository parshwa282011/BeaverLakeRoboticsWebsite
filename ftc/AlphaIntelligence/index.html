                        This year we participated in the Spencer League Meet and Tesla Interleague Tournament
                        where we won the Control Award (2nd Place) and were the first pick of the Semi-Finalist
                        Alliance.
                        In the Washington Tech Invitational (WTI), we were the second pick of the Winning Alliance.

                        Alpha Intelligence was heavily involved in outreach efforts this year. We worked with Pakistan
                        to establish an FLL team there, participated in community service activities, and partnered with
                        Troop 571 to prepare over 2,600 sandwiches for Union Gospel's homeless shelter.
