                            code the best robot that they can.

                        This year both teams participated Spencer League Meets and Tesla Interleague Tournament
                        where both teams were selected for playoffs. In WTI both teams were picked to do playoffs and
                        Alpha Intelligence won.

                        This year, Alpha Intelligence and Beta Bionix collaborated extensively on outreach initiatives.
                        We mentored three school FLL teams, showcased our robot to kids during Salmon Days, and conducted a
                        Girl Scout presentation to teach them about FIRST.
